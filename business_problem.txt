
Business problem: 

ecommerce is all about connecting people to the products they love. To help customers find those products,
they developed world-class product recommendation system, Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy
a product based on how much they liked or disliked other products. ecommerce sites use those predictions
to make personal product recommendations based on each customer’s unique tastes. Now there are a lot of 
interesting alternative approaches to how recommendation systems of ecommerce sites works that they haven’t tried.
Some are described in the literature, some aren’t. if there is a much better approach it could make a big difference
to the customers and their business.


solution:

The Popularity-based recommender system is a non-personalised recommender system and these are based on frequecy counts,
which may be not suitable to the user.The Popularity based model has recommended the same set of products to all
but Collaborative Filtering based model has recommended entire different list based on the user past purchase history.
Model-based 

"Collaborative Filtering" is a personalised recommender system, the recommendations are based on the past behavior
of the user and it is not dependent on any additional information.
